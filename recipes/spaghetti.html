        <h4>Spaghetti with Peppers and Onions</h4>
        <p>
            This is a great dish for lunch or dinner any day of the week!
            It's pretty simple and straightfoward and not very time consuming.
            I prefer to use a gluten free pasta and organic sauce and veggies when possible.
            This serves 2 people.
        </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Pasta</li>
            <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>1 or 2 onions</li>
            <li>1 red or yellow bell pepper</li>
            <li>1 or 2 jalapenos</li>
            <li>Parsley</li>
            <li>Basil</li>

            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Start boiling your salted water</li>
            <li>Chop up your onion however you prefer. Throw that in the pan on medium 
                heat first with some salt.You'll want to add the salt now to help the onion 
                release the moisture.</li>
            <li>While your onion is cooking slice the peppers into long, thin strips. If you're
                using fresh garlic chop it up finely right now as well.</li>
            <li>Throw the pasta in the boiling water.</li>
            <li>Throw the peppers and garlic into the pan with the onion.</li>
            <li>Once the peppers are cooked enough, pour in your tomato sauce.</li>
            <li>When the pasta is 2 mins away from being cooked fully, take it out of the water 
                and put straight into the pan with the sauce. </li>
            <li>Toss for 2-3 mins while adding the black and red pepper and whatever else you 
                prefer.</li>
            <li>Serve. Like a docta!</li>
        </ol>
